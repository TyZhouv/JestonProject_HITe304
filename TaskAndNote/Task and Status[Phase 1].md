> Data: February 08th
>> Task:learn the ONNX model  
>> Aim: transfer the newest model which havent been supported by jeston to ONNX model  
>> Status: Running
>>> **Work:**  
>>>1. how to Create an ONNX model： use PyTorch create an ONNX model
>>>2. Start to learn [PyTorch](https://pytorch.apachecn.org/#/docs/1.7/04)
>>>3. Skim [weblinks](https://www.google.com.hk/search?q=pytorch%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90ONNX%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B&client=ubuntu&hs=wDW&ei=YIsCYumvM5G5mAW-pLu4Bw&ved=0ahUKEwjp3_mZtfD1AhWRHKYKHT7SDncQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=pytorch%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90ONNX%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BAgAEEM6BQgAEIAEOgYIABAHEB46AggASgQIQRgASgUIQBIBMUoECEYYAFAAWLg9YK0_aAJwAXgEgAHIBogB5kOSAQwyLTIxLjMuMi4yLjGYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz)
>>>4.With [PyTorch Tutorial](https://pytorch.apachecn.org/#/docs/1.7/06) and above weblinks , we have konwn that PyTorch can Create .pth models and transfer .pth models to ONNX models.Therefore , we can  **customize the neural network model** and then transform it into ONNX model.
